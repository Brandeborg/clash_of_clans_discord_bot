The clantag extraction process is the same for most commands. It should be wrapped in a function to avoid duplicate code.

Have to stop because CoC API is down. Currently doing: 
- Create function to extract "current level" of each "unit".
- Use that and the "max level pr th" to create "paid cost / max cost" stat
- Do the same to troops and spells and TH weapon
