Currently doing: 
- Create function to extract "current level" of each "unit".
- Use that and the "max level pr th" to create "paid cost / max cost" stat
- Do the same to troops and spells and TH weapon

More notes:
- Need to consider barracks when reporting max troop levels
- Need to create a system for translating static game-file troop names to in-game dispay names given by API, 
    and to filter out builder troops etc, so only home village troops are reported.
    - When extracting the max data, use different criteria such as "Does it contain 'TUTORIAL', and whcih resource type
    is used to upgrade it.
- Might consider creating a "troop" class to hold the needed data for each troop, such as:
    - current level
    - upgade costs per level
    - function to fetch max level for current th
